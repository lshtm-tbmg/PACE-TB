# PACE-TB

This project will accelerate tuberculosis (TB) research translation by using mathematical modelling to address key priority questions in support of NIAID and FAST-TB research priorities, linking an expanded state-of-the-art modelling framework with country-level data and cross-consortium communication around new TB treatment regimens, diagnostics, and other interventions. The expanded TBMod framework will explore and compare the relative potential impact of new TB diagnostics, treatment, vaccines, and other key interventions in at least three priority countries: South Africa, India, and Brazil. Each country model will reflect a key RISK dimension that drives the TB epidemiology, which are Nutrition (India), HIV (South Africa) and Prisons (Brazil).
